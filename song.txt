Touch my body tender
'Cause the feeling makes me weak
Kicking off the covers
I see the ceiling while you're looking down at me
How can we go back to being friends
When we just shared a bed?
How can you look at me and pretend
I'm someone you've never met?
The devil in your eyes
Won't deny the lies you've sold
I'm holding on too tight
While you let go
This is casual
